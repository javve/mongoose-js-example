# Mongoose.js example

I made this repo as a resource to my presentation
[MongoDB + Node.js + ODM = Mongoose.js](http://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-MongoDB-User-Group/events/112619872/)
during a [Stockholm MongoDB User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-MongoDB-User-Group/) meetup at 23 April.

It is a example of how I use [Mongoose.js](http://mongoosejs.com/) in my personal projects. Please feel free to suggest improvements!
